# Interface for translations.  This is prefered over using Ruby's I18n directly.
# This is intended to be mixed-in to any class that requires this, so that you can more
# expediently access the `t` method.
module Brut::I18n::BaseMethods

  # Access a translation and insert interpolated elemens as needed. This will use the provided key to determine
  # the actual full key to the translation, as described below.  The value returned is not HTML escaped,
  # assuming that you have not placed HTML injections in your own translation files.  Interpolated
  # values *are* HTML escaped, so external input is safe to provide.
  #
  # This method also may take a block, and the results of the block are inserted into the `%{block}`
  # interpolation value in the i18n string, if it's present.
  #
  # Any missing interpolation will result in an exception, *except* for the value `field`. When
  # a string has `%{field}` in it, but `field:` is omitted in this call, the value for 
  # `"general.cv.this_field"` is used. This value, in English, is "this field", so a call
  # to `t("email.required")` would generate `"This field is required"`, while a call
  # to `t("email.required", field: "E-mail address")` would generate `"E-mail address is required"`.
  #
  # @param [String,Symbol,Array<String>,Array<Symbol>] key used to create one or more keys to be translated.
  #        This value's behavior is designed to a balance predictabilitiy in what actual key is chosen
  #        but without needless repetition on a page.  If this value is provided, and is an array, the values
  #        are joined with "." to form a key.  If the value is not an array, that value is used directly.
  #        Given this key, two values are checked for a translation: the key itself and 
  #        the key inside "general.".  If this value is *not* provided, it is expected
  #        taht the `**rest` hash includes page: or component:.  See that parameter and the example.
  #
  # @param [Hash] rest values to use for interpolation of the key's translation. If `key` is omitted,
  #               this hash should have a value for either `page:` or `component:` (not both).  If
  #               `page:` is present, it is assumed that the class that has included this module
  #               is a `Brut::FrontEnd::Page` or is a page component.  It's `page_name` will be used to create
  #               a key based on the value of `page:`: `pages.«page_name».«page: value»`.
  #               if `component:` is included, the behavior is the same but for `component` instead of `page`.
  # @option interpolated_values [Numeric] count Special interpolation to control pluralization.
  #
  # @raise [I18n::MissingTranslation] if no translation is found
  # @raise [I18n::MissingInterpolationArgument] if interpolation arguments are missing, or if the key
  #                                             has pluralizations and no count: was given

  # @example Simplest usage
  #   # in your translations file
  #   en: {

  #     formalized: {

  # @example Using an array for the key
  #   # in your translations file
  #   en: {
  #     general: {
  #       actions: {
  #         edit: "Make an edit"

  #   # in your code for HomePage
  #   t(page: :new_widget) # => Create new Widget
  #   # in your code for WidgetsPage
  #   t(page: :new_widget) # => Create New
