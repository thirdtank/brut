    # Regsiters a page in your app. A page is what it sounds like - a web page that's rendered from a URL.  It will be provided
    # via an HTTP get to the path provided.
    #
    # The page is rendered dynamically by using an instance of a page class as binding to HTML via ERB.  The name of the class and the name of the
    # ERB file are based on the path, according to the conventions described below.
    #
    # A few examples:
    #
    # * `page("/widgets")` will use `WidgetsPage`, and expect the HTML in `app/src/pages/widgets_page.html.erb`
    # * `page("/widgets/:id")` will use `WidgetsByIdPage`, and expect the HTML in `app/src/pages/widgets_by_id_page.html.erb`
    # * `page("/admin/widgets/:internal_id") will use `Admin::WidgetsByInternalIdPage`, and expect HTML in
    # `app/src/pages/admin/widgets_by_internal_id_page.html.erb`
    #
    # The general conventions are:
    #
    # * Each part of the path that is not a placeholder will be camelized
    # * Any part of the path that *is* a placholder has its leading colon removed, then is camelized, but appended to
    #   the previous part with `By`, thus `WidgetsById` is created from `Widgets`, `By`, and `Id`.
    # * The final part of the path is further appended with `Page`.
    # * These parts now make up a path to a class, so the entire thing is joined by `::` to form the fully-qualified class name.
    #
    # When a  GET is issued to the path, the page is instantiated.  The page's constructor may accept keyword arguments (however it must not accept
    # any other type of argument).
    #
    # Each keyword argument found will be provided when the class is created, as follows:
    #
    # * Any placeholders, so when a path `/widgets/1234` is requested, `WidgetsPage.new(id: "1234")` will be used to create the page object.
    # * Anything in the request context, such as the current user
    # * Any query string parameters 
    # * Anything passed as keyword args to this method, with the following adjustment:
    #   - Any key ending in `_class` whose value is a Class will be instantiated and
    #     passed in as the key withoutr `_class`, e.g. form_class: SomeForm will
    #     pass `form: SomeForm.new` to the constructor
    # * The flash
    #
    # Once this page object exists, `render` will be called to produce HTML to send back to the browser.

    # Declares a form that will be submitted to the app. To handle the submission you must providate
    # a handler and an optional form.  The form defines all the fields in your form, including constraints.
    # These can be used to generate HTML for the form.  When the form is submitted to your app, the form
    # is instantiated and filled in with all the values it is requesting.  That form is then passed off to the
    # configured handler.  The handle! method performs whatever processing is needed.
    #
    # If you have no form elements and are just responding to a POST action from a browser, use `action`.
    #
    # The name of the classes are based on a convention similar to `page`:
    #
    # * Each part of the path that is not a placeholder will be camelized
    # * Any part of the path that *is* a placholder has its leading colon removed, then is camelized, but appended to
    #   the previous part with `With`, thus `WidgetsWithId` is created from `Widgets`, `With`, and `Id`.
    # * The final part of the path is further appended with `Form` or `Handler`.
    # * These parts now make up a path to a class, so the entire thing is joined by `::` to form the fully-qualified class name.
    #
    # Examples:
    #
    # * `form("/widgets")` will use `WidgetsForm` and `WidgetsHandler`
    # * `form("/widgets/:id")` will use `WidgetsWithIdForm` and `WidgetsWithIdHandler`
