    # Configures models with an external id that can be safely shared publicly and safely rotated. The external
    # id is random, however it is prefixed with configurable strings that can indicate what type of model it represents.
    # This disambiguates ids when shared pubnlically or in internal tooling.
    #
    # This extension accepts a configuration option `global_prefix:` that is a string prepended to all external IDs.  This ensures
    # that your app's IDs clearly come from your app and not some other app that may be using external ids.
    #
    # To use external ids you must then call {ClassMethods#has_external_id} in your model. This method accepts a string which is
    # appended to the global prefix.  This is then *prepended* to a unique identifier.  The per-model external id prefix should
    # indicate the type of the model.  Note that it's not intended to be used programmaticallyâ€”it's only for humans to quickly see
    # what type of thing an identifier represents.
    #
    # When {ClassMethods#has_external_id} is called on your model, the column `external_id` will be set on save if it has no value.
    #
    # @example
    #    class DB::Widget < AppDataModel
    #      has_external_id "wg"
    #    end
    #
    #    Sequel::Model.plugin :external_id, global_prefix: "my"
    #
    #    widget = DB::Widget.new(name: "flux capacitor")
    #    widget.external_id # => mywg_43792834f9c3a7
