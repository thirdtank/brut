# Brut - The Raw, Simple, Powerful, Standards-Based Web Framework

Brut is a way to make web apps with Ruby, captializing on the knowledge you have—HTTP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL—without requiring
*too* much extra stuff to learn.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "brut"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install brut
