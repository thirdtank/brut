# Why Does Brut Exist?

I love writing Ruby, but grew tired of writing Rails. Rails is great, and has been
great to me over the years. I've written a lot of books about it!  But the churn and
increasing configuration burden made me think: what if we had another way to build
web apps in Ruby?

What if it was totally different, but still focused on being straightforward and
simple?  What if it had *fewer* abstractions, *less* configuration, and not as much
*stuff*?

My thinking is, you need to know HTML, JavaScript, CSS, SQL, Ruby, HTTP, and a few
other things to make a web app. What if we tried to limit the additional
abstractions you'd have to learn?

That's what Brut is trying to be.  Straightfoward, direct abstractions or
translations of stuff you already know. The raw webâ€¦or at least as raw as it can be.
