# Tutorial

A real tutorial will appear here eventually.

There are two apps you can check out in the mean time:

* [A 15-minute Blog](https://github.com/thirdtank/blog-demo) (see [demo video on how this is made](https://video.hardlimit.com/w/ae7EMhwjDq9kSH5dqQ9swV))
* [ADRs.cloud](https://github.com/thirdtank/adrs.cloud), which is a more realistic app that has
  mulitple database tables, progressively-enhanced UI, and background jobs.

You can be running either of these locally in minutes as long as you have Docker installed.
