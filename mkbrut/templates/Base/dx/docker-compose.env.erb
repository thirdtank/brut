# This file is an input to Docker Compose, and serves
# as an additional set of environment variables.

# IMAGE is the name of the image to be built for running
# your app. The recommended format is ORG/REPO:TAG
#
# The ORG and REPO are based on the values used
# with mkbrut.  TAG is set to mimic the value
# in the FROM directive of the Dockerfile.
# This will allow you to upgrade Ruby and run both
# versions more easily.
IMAGE=<%= organization %>/<%= app_name %>:ruby-3.4

# PROJECT_NAME is used when running Docker compose
# to help ensure the output includes your project's name.
PROJECT_NAME=<%= app_name %>

# DEFAULT_SERVICE is the name of the service (keys under 
# service: in docker-compose.dx.yml) to use when
# running dx/exec and no service is specified. 
# The value "app" should match that in docker-compose.dx.yml
# having the effect of dx/exec running commands inside your app's
# container.
DEFAULT_SERVICE=app
