For example, there is not a thing called &quot;CSS variables&quot;, rather the term is &quot;custom properties&quot;. HTML entities are <em>elements</em> or <em>tags</em> that have <em>attributes</em>. As another example, HTML doesn&#39;t have <em>validations</em>, rather it as <em>constraints</em>, which can be <em>violated</em>.</p><p>When speaking about Ruby, we prefer the term <em>initializer</em> over constructor, <em>parameters</em> over arguments, and <em>methods</em> over messages. We also prefer <em>tests</em> over specs, however test files <em>are</em> located in <code>specs/</code> and named <code>*.spec.rb</code> to be consistent with RSpec&#39;s nomenclature. We prefer <em>end-to-end</em> or <em>e2e</em> tests instead of browser tests or request specs.</p><p>Further, Brut doesn&#39;t render HTML, it <em>generates</em> it. The browser renders the HTML for the website&#39;s visitor. One exception is Phlex, which uses the term <em>render</em> to mean &quot;generate HTML to an internal buffer that will be delivered to the client later&quot;. Thus, you will need to call Phlex&#39;s <code>render</code> method from time to time, even though it is not rendering HTML but helping to generate it.</p><p>Lastly, the documentation tries to talk about the person accessing a website as a &quot;vistor&quot; not a &quot;user&quot;. Though the &quot;user&quot; nomenclature is near-ossified in software development, we feel &quot;visitor&quot; is more apt.</p><h2 id="structure-of-these-documents" tabindex="-1">Structure of These Documents <a class="header-anchor" href="#structure-of-these-documents" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Structure of These Documents&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Each page here documents on aspect of Brut, called a <em>module</em>, and these pages are organized along four sections:</p><ul><li><strong>Overview</strong> - provides detailed information on how this part of Brut works, with minimal examples to orient you to the terms and design of that module. Links to reference documentation are provided inline as needed.</li><li><strong>Testing</strong> - information about how to write tests for the code in this module. For example, in <a href="/pages.html">Pages</a>, we detail how you are intended to test page classes.</li><li><strong>Recommended Practices</strong> - this section outlines what we believe is the best way to use the module, along with justifications for the recommended approach. While you are free to ignore this advice, it&#39;s often useful to understand the intention of the authors.</li><li><strong>Technical Notes</strong> - where appropriate, technical details about how or why the module works the way it does are provided. This section should be marked with a date to allow you to understand the recency of the information. It may not always be up to date, but this can help further clarify what is happening under the covers and why.</li></ul><h2 id="names-of-the-library-and-associated-modules" tabindex="-1">Names of the Library and Associated Modules <a class="header-anchor" href="#names-of-the-library-and-associated-modules" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Names of the Library and Associated Modules&quot;">​</a></h2><p>This framework is called &quot;Brut&quot; though may be called &quot;BrutRB&quot;.

It kinda goes against the ethos of Brut, but it is allowing me to write documentation that looks decent and is mostly navigable. I would like to use a more accessible, customized system for documenting Brut, but for now, it&#39;s more important to get the documentation out. A better documentation experience is planned.</p>',15)]))}const p=t(r,[["render",i]]);export{m as __pageData,p as default};
