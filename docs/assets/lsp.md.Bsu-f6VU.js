That means that paths inside the Docker container must be the same as those on your computer. Brut achievecs this by using <code>${CWD}</code> inside <code>docker-compose.dx.yml</code></td><td>✅</td></tr><tr><td>Third party libraries must <em>also</em> be installed in a path that is the same in both places</td><td>When jumping to a definition, the LSP server will again use paths, which must match. Because Node modules are installed local to your app, they already work. Ruby Gems, however, are configured to be installed in <code>local-gems</code> in your app. Brut should&#39;ve added this to <code>.gitignore</code> and setup everything inside Docker to use it.</td><td>✅</td></tr><tr><td>Your editor must use <code>dx/exec</code> to execute LSP commands</td><td>Your editor will need to know that the LSP servers are running inside Docker. If your editor allows configuring the commands used to do this, you must prefix them with <code>dx/exec bashc -lc</code>.
