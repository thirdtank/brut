# Brut's High Level Architecture

Brut attempts to have parity with the web platform in general, and how web browsers work.  For example, a web browser shows you a web
page, thus to do this in Brut, you create a page class.

Brut's core ethos is to captialize on fundamental knowledge you must already posses to build a web app, such as HTML, JavaScript, the
Web Platform, SQL, etc.
