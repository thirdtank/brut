# Brut CSS - A simple utility CSS library get you started

This is a utility CSS library that provides single-purpose classes you can use together to prototpye and
design directly in your HTML or HTML-generation code.  But it is minimal.

It mostly exists to be included with BrutRB to allow developers to immediately start creating usable UI or
HTML without having to install and setup something else.  It can also be the basis of a real CSS solution
for a real app.

## Install

```
npm install brut-css
```

Then, in your CSS

```css
@import "brut-css/dist/brut.css";
```

## Usage

See [the docs](https://brutrb.com/brut-css).

## Development

This is done as part of the main Brut dev environment.
