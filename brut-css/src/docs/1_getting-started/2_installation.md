## Installation

BrutCSS is bundled with BrutRB, however you can install it via NPM:

   npm install brut-css

From there, you can use `@import` to bring it into your app:

   @import "brut-css/css/brut.css";

You can also try it without installing by use `unpkg.com`:

    <link rel="stylesheet"
          href="https://unpkg.com/brut-css/brut.min.css"/>
